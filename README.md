# blog

## These entries contain blog posts that (almost) all involve my journey in programming.

Whether you met me IRL at Meetups, discovered me on social media (Youtube, X fka Twitter) or chatted with me over Discord, however you found my Github profile, I welcome you.

Enjoy and have a great read.

\_If we met prior to you discovering this blog, then you likely know how to reach out to me. If for some reason you don't, be sure reach out to me via embedded links in my Github profile. Otherwise, I can be found as @swrrvr in most platforms online.
